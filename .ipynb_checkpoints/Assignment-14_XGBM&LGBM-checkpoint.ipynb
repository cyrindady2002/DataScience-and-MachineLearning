    "XGBoost (XGBM) slightly outperforms LightGBM (LGBM) overall, with a higher accuracy (0.70 vs. 0.68) and better precision, especially for Class 1 (0.66 vs. 0.60), indicating fewer false positives. XGBM also has better recall for Class 0 (0.86 vs. 0.81), meaning it captures more true positives in this class. Both models have similar F1-scores for Class 1 (0.52), but XGBMâ€™s higher F1 for Class 0 (0.78 vs. 0.76) gives it an edge. Thus, XGBM shows stronger overall performance, though LGBM may be preferable if prioritizing recall for Class 1."
